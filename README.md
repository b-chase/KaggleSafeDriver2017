# KaggleSafeDriver2017
Kaggle ran a contest in 2017 with a good imbalanced dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction
This repo has data & code for some test runs.
As far as I can, I'm sticking to base R and simple, commented code. Only requiring packages that are absolutely necessary.
